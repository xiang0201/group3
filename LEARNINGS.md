Team name: CareerPilot (Formerly Magic Job Hunting)
Team members: Xiang Xiong, Ticky Shi, Mayank Sethi, Lisa Kasamba

Our original plan was to develop an AI-powered job portal frontend using React, JavaScript, and CSS. And the project’s main aim was to enhance the job-seeking experience by integrating AI to provide more informative job listings. Many things changed along the way, like the team’s name for instance, from Magic Job Hunting to CareerPilot, which is catchy and concise. Likewise, we ended up not implementing user profiles nor job alerts. To a considerable extent, we would say that we were able to achieve our main goal of an enhanced job search experience through a clean finish, which in turn minimizes the “noise” which could be distracting during a job search.

Now, our project has the following functionality:
· Search jobs based on company and job title.
· Display search results in left nav.
· Search results are generated from CoreSignal API query.
· Company recommendations and preparation tips are generated from ChatGPT.
· Click on save icon saves job search result saved jobs page.
· Search results are stored in local storage (data is persisted) on the saved jobs page.
· Search results that are saved can be filtered in the search box.
· A click on one of these allows for deleting/ editing this search result.

We learned a lot from this project. For example, we all learned how to use React for the first time. Likewise, we learned that LinkedIn offers different API access levels, each with its own paid subscription. The basic access is free and provides limited access to LinkedIn's APIs. To avoid incurring this cost, we had to change from the LinkedIn to CoreSignal API to still get a list of job search results. We also had to work collaboratively to debug the React coding environment for one of our team members in order for them to run their code on their computer. A major challenge we did not seem to get around was figuring out how to collaborate of GitHub in terms of being able to pull and push code. Hence, we ended up with at least three different repositories. Overall, we were able to to fruitfully communicate as a unit and each member was a team player who played a role to ensure the success of our project.
