cd careerpilot
```

npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following npm scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified and optimized for the best performance. The generated app is ready to be deployed. See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

This command is a one-way operation. It removes the single build dependency from your project. Use with caution, and only if you need full control over the build tools and configuration.
